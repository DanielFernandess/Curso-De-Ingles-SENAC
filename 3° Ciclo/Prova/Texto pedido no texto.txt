Alef Manoel Da Casta e França was born in the city of Mossoró - RN, on 12/18/2001, but lives in the city of Apodi - RN. He studied at the "Estadual Professor Antonio Dantas" school, however he did not want to finish his studies and today he works as a private teacher, teaching children. In his spare time, he likes to play the guitar, piano and drums, he is very talented in the instrumental part. He is my best friend, even though we live in the same city, we live far away, but we see each other frequently, especially when we get together to play instruments together, or when we go out to eat.
