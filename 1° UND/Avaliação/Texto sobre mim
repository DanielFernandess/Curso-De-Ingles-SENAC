I study at UFERSA in Pau Dos Ferros, IT course I have the technician, and today I am studying for graduation!

My name is Daniel, I live in Brazil and I'm Brazilian, I love seeing the world and I dream of visiting the US, but I don't speak English kkk.

My favorite color is red, I love wearing a red t-shirt with jen shorts.

My biggest distraction is eating pizza with my friends, but I don't like olives, not like hahaha.
